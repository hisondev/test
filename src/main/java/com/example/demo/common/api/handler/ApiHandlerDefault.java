/**
 * Default implementation of the ApiHandler interface.
 * This class provides basic handling for API requests and exceptions, and can be extended for custom behavior.
 * It is part of a factory pattern implemented in ApiHandlerFactory, enabling developers to customize API handling logic.
 * 
 * <p>Key Features:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Implements essential API handling methods such as beforeHandleRequest, handleAuthority, handleLog, and afterHandleRequest.</li>
 * <li>Provides standard responses for ApiException, ServiceRuntimeException, generic Exception, and Throwable.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>Customization:</p>
 * 
 * Developers can create a custom handler, such as CustomApiHandler, extending ApiHandlerDefault to override and implement custom logic.
 * This custom handler can be registered in the application startup:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *     &#64;SpringBootApplication
 *     public class DemoApplication {
 *         public static void main(String[] args) {
 *             CustomApiHandler.register();
 *         }
 *     }
 * </pre>
 * ApiHandlerFactory facilitates this customization by returning the custom handler when set, otherwise defaulting to ApiHandlerDefault.
 * <p>Usage Example:</p>
 * <pre>
 *     public class CustomApiHandler extends ApiHandlerDefault {
 *         public static void register() {
 *              ApiHandlerFactory.setCustomHandler(new CustomApiHandler());
 *         }
 *         // Override methods for custom behavior
 *     }
 * </pre>
 * ApiHandlerDefault is essential for handling API requests and providing a structured approach to error handling in API operations.
